###HOW TO USE AND MODIFY###

The map "suite", as it were, consists of three files:
NS-Globe.kmz: Open with Google Earth for a low-res, spherical view of the planet.
wholeproj.png: Use this for quick reference and broad compatability.
worldmap.svg: Open with Inkscape for editing and creating derivative works.

The SVG has a hierarchical system of "layers". Each region on the map has its own layer, with sublayers for the names of its nations, its national borders, and the color fills for each of its nations. The base geography (the off-white land masses) are stored in the "base" layer. All land masses should be represented on this layer. A "notes and guides" layer exists for storing things like demarcations between regional areas, as well as notations that may be usefull in creating the map, such as lines for the arctic and antarctic circles.

Generally speaking, cartography is generated with Inkscape's "pencil" tool with a smoothing rate of 20 at 1600% zoom. This isn't a requirement, but I've found it tends to yeild pretty good results. 

Please refer to GitHub's instructions on branching repositories. Further procedures for mainlining your modifications will come later.
